    """bTCP server socket
    A server application makes use of the services provided by bTCP by calling
    accept, recv, and close.

    You're implementing the transport layer, exposing it to the application
    layer as a (variation on) socket API. Do note, however, that this socket
    as presented is *always* in "listening" state, and handles the client's
    connection in the same socket. You do not have to implement a separate
    listen socket. If you get everything working, you may do so for some extra
    credit.

    To implement the transport layer, you also need to interface with the
    network (lossy) layer. This happens by both calling into it
    (LossyLayer.send_segment) and providing callbacks for it
    (BTCPServerSocket.lossy_layer_segment_received, lossy_layer_tick).

    Your implementation will operate in two threads, the network thread,
    where the lossy layer "lives" and where your callbacks will be called from,
    and the application thread, where the application calls connect, send, etc.
    This means you will need some thread-safe information passing between
    network thread and application thread.
    Writing a boolean or enum attribute in one thread and reading it in a loop
    in another thread should be sufficient to signal state changes.
    Lists, however, are not thread safe, so to pass data and segments around
    you probably want to use Queues, or a similar thread safe collection.

    ### The following section is the interface between the transport layer  ###
    ### and the lossy (network) layer. When a segment arrives, the lossy    ###
    ### layer will call the lossy_layer_segment_received method "from the   ###
    ### network thread". In that method you should handle the checking of   ###
    ### the segment, and take other actions that should be taken upon its   ###
    ### arrival, like acknowledging the segment and making the data         ###
    ### available for the application thread that calls to recv can return  ###
    ### the data.                                                           ###
    ###                                                                     ###
    ### Of course you can implement this using any helper methods you want  ###
    ### to add.                                                             ###

    ### Since the implementation is inherently multi-threaded, you should   ###
    ### use a Queue, not a List, to transfer the data to the application    ###
    ### layer thread: Queues are inherently threadsafe, Lists are not.      ###

    def lossy_layer_segment_received(self, segment):
        """Called by the lossy layer whenever a segment arrives.

        Things you should expect to handle here (or in helper methods called
        from here):
            - checksum verification (and deciding what to do if it fails)
            - receiving syn and client's ack during handshake
            - receiving segments and sending acknowledgements for them,
              making data from those segments available to application layer
            - receiving fin and client's ack during termination
            - any other handling of the header received from the client

        Remember, we expect you to implement this *as a state machine!*
        You have quite a bit of freedom in how you do this, but we at least
        expect you to *keep track of the state the protocol is in*,
        *perform the appropriate state transitions based on events*, and
        *alter behaviour based on that state*.

        So when you receive the segment, do the processing that is common
        for all states (verifying the checksum, parsing it into header values
        and data...).
        Then check the protocol state, do appropriate state-based processing
        (e.g. a FIN is not an acceptable segment in ACCEPTING state, whereas a
        SYN is).
        Finally, do post-processing that is common to all states.

        You could e.g. implement the state-specific processing in a helper
        function per state, and simply call the appropriate helper function
        based on which state you are in.
        In that case, it will be very helpful to split your processing into
        smaller helper functions, that you can combine as needed into a larger
        function for each state.

        If you are on Python 3.10, feel free to use the match ... case
        statement.
        If you are on an earlier Python version, an if ... elif ...  elif
        construction can be used; just make sure to check the same variable in
        each elif.

    ### You're also building the socket API for the applications to use.    ###
    ### The following section is the interface between the application      ###
    ### layer and the transport layer. Applications call these methods to   ###
    ### accept connections, receive data, etc. Conceptually, this happens   ###
    ### in "the application thread".                                        ###
    ###                                                                     ###
    ### You *can*, from this application thread, send segments into the     ###
    ### lossy layer, i.e. you can call LossyLayer.send_segment(segment)     ###
    ### from these methods without ensuring that happens in the network     ###
    ### thread. However, if you do want to do this from the network thread, ###
    ### you should use the lossy_layer_tick() method above to ensure that   ###
    ### segments can be sent out even if no segments arrive to trigger the  ###
    ### call to lossy_layer_segment_received. When passing segments between ###
    ### the application thread and the network thread, remember to use a    ###
    ### Queue for its inherent thread safety. Whether you need to send      ###
    ### segments from the application thread into the lossy layer is up to  ###
    ### you; you may find you can handle all receiving *and* sending of     ###
    ### segments in the lossy_layer_segment_received and lossy_layer_tick   ###
    ### methods.                                                            ###

    ### Note that because this is the server socket, and our (initial)      ###
    ### implementation of bTCP is one-way reliable data transfer, there is  ###
    ### no send() method available to the applications. You should still    ###
    ### be able to send segments on the lossy layer, however, because       ###
    ### of acknowledgements and synchronization. You should implement that  ###
    ### above.                                                              ###

        accept should *block* (i.e. not return) until a connection has been
        successfully established (or some timeout is reached, if you want. Feel
        free to add a timeout to the arguments). You will need some
        coordination between the application thread and the network thread for
        this, because the syn and final ack from the client will be received in
        the network thread.

        Hint: assigning to a boolean or enum attribute in thread A and reading
        it in a loop in thread B (preferably with a short sleep to avoid
        wasting a lot of CPU time) ensures that thread B will wait until the
        boolean or enum has the expected value. You can also put some kind of
        "signal" (e.g. BTCPSignals.CONNECT, or BTCPStates.FIN_SENT) in a Queue,
        and use a blocking get() on the other side to receive that signal.

        We do not think you will need more advanced thread synchronization in

        a reliable way.

        If no data is available to return to the application, this method
        should block waiting for more data to arrive. If the connection has
        been terminated, this method should return with no data (e.g. an empty
        bytes b'').

        If you want, you can add an argument to this method stating how many
        bytes you want to receive in one go at the most (but this is not
        required for this project).

        You are free to implement this however you like, but the following
        explanation may help to understand how sockets *usually* behave and you
        may choose to follow this concept as well:

        The way this usually works is that "recv" operates on a "receive
        buffer". Once data has been successfully received and acknowledged by
        the transport layer, it is put "in the receive buffer". A call to recv
        will simply return data already in the receive buffer to the
        application.  If no data is available at all, the method will block
        until at least *some* data can be returned.
        The actual receiving of the data, i.e. reading the segments, sending
        acknowledgements for them, reordering them, etc., happens *outside* of
        the recv method (e.g. in the network thread).
        Because of this blocking behaviour, an *empty* result from recv signals
        that the connection has been terminated.

        Again, you should feel free to deviate from how this usually works.
